Q.Advantages of Inheritance:

1. Code Reus-ability: Inheritance allows you to reuse code from existing classes,
reducing the need to rewrite the same code multiple times. You can create new classes
that inherit behavior and attributes from a parent class, thus promoting code reuse
and minimizing redundancy.

2. Extensibility: You can extend the functionality of existing classes by creating subclasses.
Subclasses inherit the properties and methods of their parent class and can add new features
or modify existing ones. This promotes a modular approach to programming and makes it easier
to add new functionality without affecting existing code.

3. Polymorphism: Inheritance facilitates polymorphism, which is the ability of objects of
different classes to respond to the same method in a way that is appropriate for their specific type.
This enhances flexibility and allows for more generic and reusable code.

4. Hierarchical Structure: Inheritance creates a hierarchical structure among classes,
which can make the code more organized and easier to understand. It represents relationships
and dependencies between classes in a natural and intuitive way.

5. Maintenance and Updates: When you need to make changes to a shared behavior or attribute,
you can update the parent class, and those changes will automatically propagate to all
the subclasses. This simplifies maintenance and ensures consistency in the codebase.
