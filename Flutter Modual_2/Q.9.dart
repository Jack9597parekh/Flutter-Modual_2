Q. Can a class implement more than one interface?

--> Yes, a class in Dart can implement more than one interface. Dart supports multiple interface inheritance,
allowing a class to declare that it implements multiple interfaces by listing them separated by
commas in the class declaration. This enables a class to inherit and provide implementations for
multiple sets of behaviors defined in different interfaces.
